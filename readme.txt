Simplest way to manage your backups with VOGAPress cloud service. Added with file monitoring to let you know when your website has been compromised.

== Description ==

Do you have an adequate WordPress backup strategy to ensure you can recover from disasters and hacks?  While hosting companies often offer backup solutions to recover from hardware failure, their offerings are basic replicate and restore functions without monitoring the states of the files.  This makes it harder to detect what and when files are tempered by hackers.

It's a cloud backup service that offers to keep track and notifiy you of the file changes, and, an easy user interface to visually compare files before deciding what to restore.  Restoring is a simple 2-clicks action with options to select individual file, file types, and, database.

Replicate, Review, and Restore.  Try Backup by VOGAPress to see what you're missing.  *It's free to try during the beta period.  No credit card is required to register.*
